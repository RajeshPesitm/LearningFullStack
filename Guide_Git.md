# how to clone commit 1 when Head is pointing to commit 2 and commit 1 being the previous 

To clone or **check out a previous commit (commit 1)** when the current `HEAD` is pointing to a newer commit (commit 2), follow these steps after cloning the repository:

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository (if not already done):**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **List the commit history to find commit 1:**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   a1b2c3d Commit 2 (HEAD)
   1234567 Commit 1
   ```

3. **Check out the previous commit (Commit 1):**

   ```bash
   git checkout 1234567
   ```

   Replace `1234567` with the actual commit hash of Commit 1.

   > This puts you in a **detached HEAD** state — you're not on a branch.

# Check out the previous commit (Commit 1):<--- how to undo this

If you've checked out a previous commit (Commit 1) and you want to **undo** this action and return to the state where you were previously (usually the latest commit or the branch you were on), here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Return to the Latest Commit on the Current Branch**

To return to the latest commit on your current branch (usually `main` or `master`), you can check out that branch again:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Or, if you were working on a different branch:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

> This command will bring you back to the **latest commit** on the branch, essentially "undoing" the detached HEAD state.

---

### 2. **If You Want to Restore to the Exact Commit You Were On (before detaching HEAD)**

If you were working on a branch and want to get back to exactly where you were before checking out Commit 1, you can use `git reflog` to find your previous position:

1. Check the reflog to find your recent HEAD movements:

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

   This will show something like:

   ```
   a1b2c3d HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from main to 1234567
   a1b2c3d HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from 1234567 to main
   ```

2. You can then use `git checkout` to return to the exact state you were before the detachment:

   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD@{1}
   ```

   Replace `{1}` with the relevant index based on the reflog.

---

### 3. **If You Made Changes and Want to Discard Them**

If you made any changes while in the detached HEAD state (or even staged changes), and you want to discard them, use:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

> Be careful with `git reset --hard` as it will discard **all uncommitted changes**.
